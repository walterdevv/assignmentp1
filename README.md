Walter Cooper
Assignment P1: First GUI Development Project

This project is a very simple GUI application which displays the
French words for numbers 1-5 when you click the button for each number.
This application is built using Python with the Tkinter library.

I encountered no major possible issues in the development, however
I did have a bit of trouble making everything look clean.

Instructions:
To run the program, simply open a powershell window in the folder
and run the command "py french_numbers.py"
